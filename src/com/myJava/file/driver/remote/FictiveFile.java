/**
 * This class extends the default "File" structure.
 * <BR>It represents a fictive local or a remote file.
 * <BR>In both cases, it does not exist on the local file system.
 * <BR>It does not redefine fileSystem actions such as "delete", "mkdir", ... (these actions are the resposibility of the FileSystemDriver)
 * but keep technical informations in cache such as file size, isDirectory, ... (to avoid making multiple remote accesses for the same file)
